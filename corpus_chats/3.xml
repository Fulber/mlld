			<Utterance genid="14" ref="13" time="10:47:17">You are in the board of decisions of a company that plans to use collaborative technologies for its activities. Each of you has studies the advantages and disadvantages of the following technologies that are considered by the company: chat, blog, wiki, forums and Google Wave. Engage into a collaborative discussion in order to decide for which activities it is indicated to use each technology and for which ones it is not indicated. You should give the best advice for the technology that you support and convince the others to use it. The result of this discussion should be a plan of using these technologies in order to have the best outcomes for your company. You can also think of other useful technologies beside these ones, but do not insist on them.</Utterance>

This allows them to share and preview product features, functions, and benefits before the products are released. Blogs are an excellent way to gather feedback and to make sure products meet the needs of users. Blogs have become the next generation marketing tool to corporate websites which merely post collateral and do not provide any interactive feedback. Blogs are also supplementary to a User Group. User Groups happen annually for example while blogs provide users constant daily and weekly feedback.</Utterance>
